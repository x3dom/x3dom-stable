Welcome to X3DOM 
================

X3DOM is a framework for integrating and manipulating (X)3D scenes as HTML5 DOM elements, which are rendered via an X3D plugin, Flash/Stage3D or WebGL. The open-source system allows defining 3D scene description and runtime behavior declaratively, without any low-level JavaScript or GLSL coding.
