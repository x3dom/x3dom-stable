# X3DOM - Stable Builds via jsDelivr

This repository serves as a source for obtaining stable builds of the X3DOM library through the [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) content delivery network (CDN).

## Usage
To include one of the stable builds of X3DOM in your web application, you can use the following URL in your HTML code:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/x3dom/x3dom-stable@version/dist/x3dom.js"></script>
```

Replace `version` with the specific version number you want to include (e.g., `v1.8.3`). By specifying a version in the URL, you can ensure that your web application uses a stable and tested release of X3DOM, which is suitable for production environments and applications that require higher reliability.

Remember to check the [X3DOM releases page](https://github.com/x3dom/x3dom/releases) on GitHub to find the available versions and their respective release notes for more information about each release.

## Including the latest development Build via jsDelivr

If you prefer to use the latest development build of X3DOM for your web application, you can easily do so by referencing the appropriate URL in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/x3dom/x3dom-dev/dist/x3dom.js"></script>
```

Please note that the develop build contains the most recent code changes, which may not be as stable as the official releases. Use it with caution, and it's recommended to check the official X3DOM repository for updates and changes.

We recommend using the stable build for most projects, as it guarantees a reliable and well-tested version of the X3DOM library. However, if you are interested in exploring the latest features and improvements, you can also refer to the previous section to include the latest develop build.

Whether you choose to include a stable build or the latest development build, jsDelivr provides a fast and reliable content delivery network that ensures efficient delivery of the X3DOM library to your web application.
